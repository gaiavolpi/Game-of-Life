### Project description 

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that is played on a 2D square grid. Each cell on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they evolve according to the following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two or more than three live neighbours dies. 
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.

We also implemented a stochastic version of such game, introducing noise in the dynamics parametrized by a fictitious temperature T. As shown in the reference paper [Schulman, L.S., Seiden, P.E. Statistical mechanics of a dynamical system based on Conway's game of Life. J Stat Phys 19, 293â€“314 (1978)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01011727), the model displays a critical temperature.
