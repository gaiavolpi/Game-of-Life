# LCP-Project

*Final_version.ipynb* contains the main visualization of our project, while the functions used are contained both in *create_pattern.py* and in *gameoflife.py*.

*Pygame_GoL.ipynb* contains instead the implementation of GoL using pygame, for a better visualization of complex patterns. It is also possible to manually insert a seed using this program. 

*'patterns'* folder contains a database of the patterns we used as seed in our project, they're saved in .rle format and decoded by us with the *'rle_decoder'* function (inside create_pattern.py).
