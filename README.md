*Pygame_GoL.ipynb* containes insted the implementation of GoL using pygame, for a better visualization of complex patterns. It is also possible to manually insert a seed using this program. 

*'patterns'* folder containes a database of the pattern we used as seed in our project, they're saved in .rle format and decoded by us with the *'rle_decoder'* function (inside create_pattern.py).
